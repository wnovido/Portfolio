            <p><b>Where it all started…</b></p>
            <p>I began my career more than 23 years ago after graduating from a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Engineering from Mapua Institute of Technology (Philippines). Using MS Foxpro, I developed a system that was implemented in local networks such as 88Mart and Duty Free Philippines. Back then, I had no idea that it would jumpstart a profession that will lead to the wealth of database and web development knowledge I have right now.</p>

            <p><b>How my expertise grew…</b></p>            
            <p>From 1993 to 1998, I worked in companies located in the Philippines as a programmer/systems analyst then as a senior programmer. My responsibilities included coordinating data gathering, systems analysis and design, programming, user training, implementation of customized systems, production support, database application development, training activities, systems documentation, and unit testing in client-server set-up.</p>

            <p>When my family migrated to the United States in 1998, I first served as a consultant for Ajilon Consulting, Inc., in North Carolina until 2001 and provided programming and analytic expertise as part of a team that designs, develops, and maintains programs to meet our clients’ internal and external needs. I was directly involved in development, certification, and user acceptance testing, including major debugging. I’ve also migrated and converted major Pro*C programs to Oracle Reports.</p>

            <p><b>How I evolved…</b></p>
            <p>The next seven years found me as a Senior Analyst for Cenduit, a joint venture with Fisher Clinical Services and Quintiles, There, I handled requisite tasks in the Clinical IVR (Interactive Voice Response) System involving Oracle, PL/SQL, SQL, SQL*Plus, Toad, and Brio Report Builder.</p>

            <p>In 2008, I moved to Merge Healthcare, Inc. as a Senior Application Developer for its Clinical IWR (Interactive Web Response)/IVR System and developed the customization of simple to complex drug studies as well as designed, programmed, and unit tested modules using Merge software and other development tools, among other things. I likewise served as an effective, positive team member and resource person for other application developers.</p>

            <p><b>What I can do for YOU …</b></p>
            <p>Presently, I develop customized web applications for small specialty businesses as well as do consultancy for company like Lifescale Analytics where I provide web programming and analytic expertise using MongoDB, JavaScript, Express.js, AngularJS, Node.js, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 3.3.4, Karma.  In addition, I currently volunteer as a teacher assistant for Girl Develop It and as a web master for the North Carolina Basketball League.</p>

            <p>With 23+ years of database and development expertise using various database products and the latest cutting edge web technology languages and tools . . . I code . . . I develop . . . I deliver . . . I make it happen!!!</p>
